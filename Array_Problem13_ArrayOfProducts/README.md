# Short Intro

## 🔍 Problem Overview:

The challenge is to find an array where each element is the product of every other number in the input array except the one at the current index.

## 🌟 Example:

Input: [5,1,4,2]
Solution: [8,40,10,20]

the problem wants us to return an array where each element is the product of every other element in the array.

# Simple Walkthrough

## Nested Loops (Brute Force)

📝 Description:

- Initialization: Create an empty array to store the final products.
- Outer Loop: Iterate through each element of the input array.
- Inner Loop: For each element, iterate again over the array.
- Product Calculation: Multiply all elements except the one at the current index of the outer loop.
- Avoid Self-Multiplication: Skip multiplication when the inner loop index matches the outer loop index.
- Storing Results: After the inner loop, store the calculated product in the result array at the current index of the outer loop.

🕒 Time Complexity: O(n^2)
📚 Space Complexity: O(n)

## Auxiliary Arrays with Two Non-Nested Loops

📝 Description:

- Two Arrays: Initialize two arrays to store the products of elements to the left and right of each index.
- Left Products: Traverse from left to right. Multiply all preceding elements and store at the current index.
- Right Products: Traverse from right to left. Multiply all following elements and store at the current index.
- Initial Values: Start with a product value of 1 for both leftmost and rightmost indices.
- Final Product: Iterate over the input array and multiply the corresponding left and right products for each index.

🕒 Time Complexity: O(n)
📚 Space Complexity: O(n)

## Single Array With Accumulating Values (Optimal)

📝 Description:

- Single Result Array: Start with an array initialized with 1's for storing final products.
- Left Products: First pass through the input array from left to right.
- Accumulate Left Products: Multiply the current element with the product of all elements to its left and store.
- Right Products: Second pass from right to left.
- Accumulate and Multiply: Multiply each element with the product of all elements to its right and update in place.
- One-Pass Update: No need for separate arrays, updating the result array in place.

🕒 Time Complexity: O(n)
📚 Space Complexity: O(n)

# Analysis

- The brute force approach is straightforward but inefficient for large arrays due to its quadratic time complexity.
- The optimized approach with auxiliary arrays improves efficiency but uses extra space for left and right product arrays.
- The most efficient approach optimizes both time and space by updating the result array in place, making it the best choice for large datasets.
